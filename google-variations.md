# Google Variations

These are variations of the kata described that could be used to make it more GCP specific. To use these variations it may be useful to extend the design period by 10â€“20 minutes.

## 1. Google Cloud Variation

The task is altered to specify that the customer already has systems on Google Cloud Platform and would like to use GCP where possible. In this variation, teams are given the [Google Cloud Developer's Cheatsheet](./materials/google/gcp-poster.pdf) for reference. 

Another good resource would be the book [Visualising Google Cloud](https://cloud.google.com/blog/topics/developers-practitioners/introducing-visualizing-google-cloud-101-illustrated-references-cloud-engineers-and-architects) by [Priyanka Vergadia](https://www.linkedin.com/in/pvergadia/).

## 2. Google Green Software Variation

The task is as a variation one, but in addition, the teams are given the [Google Go Green Software Guide] (./materials/google/google-green-software.pdf) and a requirement added to the task for teams to consider how the software could be made less carbon intensive.

## 3. Google GenAI Variation

The task builds on variation one or two. However, with 30 minutes remaining of the design session, the teams are given access to a laptop with Google Gemini or Duet AI and encouraged to ask for assistance in making design decisions.
