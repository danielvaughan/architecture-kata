# Introduction Script

## Architecture Kata?

"So how are we supposed to get great architects if they only get the chance to
architect fewer than a half-dozen times in their career?"

This is what Ted Neward, the inventor of architect katas asked himself. Then he
saw his son at karate practice. In Karate, a kata is an exercise designed to
give students the opportunity to practice not only basics but also being
prepared for real situations. An architecture kata is a chance to learn and
practice software architecture in a safe environment, and that is what we are
going to do today.

## Form small teams

In a moment I will ask you to get into small teams. Ideally three to four, but
if you want to form larger teams that is ok too.

There are two rules, try to avoid being with people you normally work with and
make sure everyone in the team as the opportunity to contribute. The reason for
this is it lets you see how people from different teams approach the problem.
For example, someone used to designing infrastructure with has a different
perspective to a security specialist.

## Review the RFP

On the table, you will see the requirements of a system our customer has asked
us to propose a design for.

As in the real world, it may not have all the information you need, so we will
act of Product Managers and if you have questions, please ask us and we will do
our best to answer.

## Design your solution

You have about 50 minutes to design your solution. Areas you might consider are
programming language choice, broader technology choices (tools, services etc.)
and architecture design.

## Present your solution

There is paper, post-its and pens on the tables to use. There is no need for
laptops.

At the end of the session, each group will have 5 minutes to present their
solution and answer questions. From when I have done this before, it is hard to
see detailed diagrams so think about how to present your design.

Ok, let's get into teams.
