# Product Manager Brief

You are playing the role of Product Manager in this scenario. Your job is ensuring the product aligns with the business goals, meets the defined requirements, stays within budget, and is delivered on time.

Avoid answering specific technical questions from the teams. “I’m not technical” is a good answer. However, you can have opinions on business priorities, and these can differ from other product managers.

The requirements are deliberately not complete, to reflect the real-world scenario where we often need to ask customers questions to elicit further information or requirements.

That said below are important notes than can be shared with the groups, as and when they ask:

* **Existing Payment System**: The restaurant chain operates with an existing payment system that offers HTTP API access. Any new development must be compatible with this system.
* **Management Console**: The system requires a secure management console, accessible only to authenticated users, for administrative tasks.
* **Operational Hours**: The restaurants operate daily from 10am to 10pm, which could influence certain system functionalities, such as booking and ordering.
* **Gift Voucher System**: There's an existing, albeit outdated and slow, system for redeeming gift vouchers via HTTP APIs. While it's scheduled for a future overhaul, the current integration must account for its limitations.
* **Menu Management**: Restricted access for menu updates is necessary. Only designated staff members should have the permissions to modify menu items, prices, and images.
* **Booking Integration**: The new system should integrate with the existing booking system for handling future reservations.
* **Future Plans**: There are currently 20 restaurants in the chain and each outlet had 50 covers. If this concept is successful there is the possibility of expansion into Asian markets and/or franchising.
