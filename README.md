# Architecture Kata for GCP

## What is an Architecture Kata?
Imagine trying to build a house without an expert architect. The risk of failure is high. Just like a house needs good planning to stay up, software needs effective architecture to succeed over time. Architecture in software is about planning to avoid problems and making sure the software can keep up with changing requirements.

The role of software architect can be a hat software engineers wear or a specialised position depending on the organisation. The problem is seasoned architects seldom have the opportunity to design a system from the ground up.

"So how are we supposed to get great architects, if they only get the chance to architect fewer than a half-dozen times in their career?"

This is a problem that Ted Neward set out to solve. In Karate there is the concept of a Kata a sequence of moves you practice over again until you build muscle memory. The idea being by practicing in a safe environment when you face a real-life situation you can respond instinctively.

If you have seen the film Karate Kid where Daniel spends all day waxing Mr Magie’s car or paint his fence, you’ll get the idea.

Ted created the concept of the Architecture Kata that follows the same principle. A workshop that gives the opportunity to practice software architecture in a risk-free environment and build the skills needed for real projects.
