# Architecture Kata â€” Facilitator Playbook

## Objectives

The goal of an architecture kata is for teams to design a system in response to a Request for Proposal (RFP) from a fictitious customer. Teams then come tegether to present their solution to the group. 

The requirements are deliberately incomplete with facilitators acting as Product Managers to clarify requirements and provide context by answering questions. 

One of the main benefits of this exercise is the appreciation of different perspectives and approaches to the problem both from teammates in the design phase and from other teams in the presentation phase. This can be reinforced by an optional retrospective at the end of the session.

## Source

The Architecture Kata was initially developed by Ted Neward. This example RFP used in this exercise is based on one developed by [Matthew Belcher](https://www.linkedin.com/in/matthewbelcher/).

## Teams

Participants form teams of ideally 3-4 people. Although teams of up to six can work this does risk decreased collaborations as one or two people tend to dominate larger teams. As each team needs to present for 5 minutes it is recommended that the maximum number of teams is five.

## Duration

The typical duration of this workshop will be 90-120 minutes depending on the number of teams and so the time required for presentations and whether there is a retrospective.

### Suggested Timings 

* Welcome and introduction presentation (5 minutes)
* Design time (50 minutes)
* Presentations (25 minutes)
* Retrospective (10 minutes)

## Material Required

* A room with tables and chairs for teams to sit around
* A1 flip chart paper
* Post-it notes
* Sharpie markers
* Facilitators to act as Product Managers - ideally more than one when more than three teams.
* Several paper versions of the [Participant Handout](./materials/participant-handout.md) per team.
* A paper version of the [Product Manager Brief](./materials/product-manager-brief.md) for each facilitator.
